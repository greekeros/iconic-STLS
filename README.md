### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/gmail--v2.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Login with Email and Password
- User information is saved in the MongoDB database.
- The password is hashed first and then stored.
- Authentication is done using JSON Web Token (JWT).
- The calendar after successful login would be an empty one.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/microsoft.png" width="30px" />&ensp;Login with Microsoft
- User signs-in with their Microsoft Account.
- Authentication is done using Microsoft Authentication Library(MSAL).
- The calendar after successful login will be synced with user's Outlook Calendar.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/video-call--v2.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Group Video Calling
- The group video call is implemented using Agora Web SDK NG.
- Agora Web SDK NG enables audio and video real-time communications.
- It has a Selective Forwarding Unit(SFU) Architecture.
- All clients connected on a particular channel publish their audio and video tracks to the server.
- The server is then broadcasting the received tracks to the other participants present in the call.

#### But why SFU over Mesh Networking?
i. Mesh Networking
  - Suppose A, B and C are connected through a video call. Then each person is sending their audio and video stream to every other person.
  -	High upload speed required (which is not common)
  -	Maximum of 4 people can connect through video call.

ii. Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
  -	Suppose A, B and C are connected through a video call. Then each person is sending their audio and video stream only once to the server.
  -	The server is then broadcasting the received stream to the other participants.
  -	High download speed required (which is common)
  -	More than 10 people can connect through video call.

- Screen Share functionality is also implemented with Agora Web SDK NG.
- It is achieved through replacing the video track of the user with ze's screen track.
- And vice-versa when the user wants to stop screen sharing.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/30/3498DB/pin3--v2.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Screen Pinning
- A user can pin other user's video or screen whenever is required.
- Pinning a user's video/screen means making ze's video/screen fullscreen.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/block-microphone--v2.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Mute/Unmute Audio/Video
- This is done by unpublishing user's audio/video stream to the server.
- The server relays this information to all other clients.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/calendar--v2.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Event Scheduling on Calendar
- Syncfusion scheduler is used for implementing the calendar.
- An events collection is created in the MongoDB database which serves as the data source for the calendar.
- API requests to the database are made to do Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD) operations on the events collection through the calendar.
- A user can add attendees to the event, when ze is creating an event.
- That event is then visible on the attendee's calendar as well.
- A meeting link for the video conference is automatically generated when an event is created.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/microsoft-outlook-2019--v2.png" width="30px" />&ensp;Syncing with Microsoft Outlook Calendar
- Microsoft Graph API is used for syncing the syncfusion scheduler with the Outlook Calendar.
- Authentication is done using Microsoft Authentication Library(MSAL).
- CRUD operations are performed through the Graph API.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/chat--v3.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Chat
- Whenever a user schedules an event on the calendar, a particular chat space for that event is created.
- The creator of the event and all the attendees are added to that particular chat space.
- They can chat before the event begins, during the event as well as they can continue their chat after the event ends.
- The chat participants can share both text and images with each other.
- A user can also create individual as well as group chats themselves by adding other participants to the chat.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/github--v3.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;GitHub Integration
- A user can explore and look upon other users profiles and their public repositories by searching for the user.
- Ze can also look at ze's private repositories.
- All the folders and files of the repository are accessible.
- Commit history in the repository can also be seen.
- Moreover you can see the repository issues, create new issues and comment on existing issues.
- You can do all this even while being in a meeting and discussing the product issues with your team.
- GitHub V3 API has been used to achieve this functionality.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/doodle/48/000000/whiteboard.png" width="30px" />&ensp;Collaborative Blackboard
- Draw collaboratively with your team while being in a video conference.
- User can still create a collaborative drawing space even if ze's not in a meeting and share link of the board with ze's team.
- A user can download the board as an image after ze's done drawing.

### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/30/3498DB/voice-presentation--v2.gif" width="30px" />&ensp;Voice Assistant
- Alan AI is used to integrate a voice assistant into the application.
- Navigation in the web app can be done using voice commands.
- Events/Meetings on the calendar can be scheduled, updated and deleted using voice commands.

#### Commands that can be used
- All simple conversations
- Ask about what this application does
- Schedule a meeting on specific date and time
- Schedule a meeting now
- Postpone/Prepone a meeting
- Delete a meeting
